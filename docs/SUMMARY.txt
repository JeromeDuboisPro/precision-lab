PRECISION LAB - GITHUB PAGES LANDING PAGE
==========================================

COMPLETED DELIVERABLES:

1. Landing Page (index.html)
   - Hero section with project mission
   - 4 key findings cards (precision floors, cascading wins, early progress, residual norm)
   - Methodology section with algorithm explanation and experiment parameters
   - Interactive visualization cards linking to race.html and cascading.html
   - About section with project context
   - Professional, modern design with dark theme

2. Precision Race Visualization (race.html)
   - Animated convergence curves for FP8, FP16, FP32, FP64
   - Logarithmic Y-axis showing residual norm
   - Play/Pause/Reset controls with adjustable speed
   - Real-time iteration counters for each precision
   - Key observations section explaining precision floors
   - Color-coded legend (FP8=orange, FP16=blue, FP32=green, FP64=purple)

3. Cascading Precision Visualization (cascading.html)
   - Animated demonstration of FP8→FP16→FP32→FP64 strategy
   - Current precision indicator with dynamic color
   - Segment-based rendering showing precision transitions
   - Iteration counters per precision level
   - Transition details showing when and why escalations occur
   - Explanation of cascading strategy and performance gains

4. Shared Styles (styles.css)
   - Modern dark theme (navy/purple palette)
   - Responsive grid layouts
   - CSS custom properties for consistent colors
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Mobile-responsive breakpoints
   - Accessible typography with clear hierarchy

5. Visualization JavaScript (js/visualizations.js)
   - Chart.js-based animated visualizations
   - AnimatedVisualization base class with play/pause/reset
   - PrecisionRaceVisualization for multi-trace comparison
   - CascadingPrecisionVisualization for segment-based rendering
   - Logarithmic scale handling for residual norms
   - Real-time data updates synchronized with animation frames

6. Data Files (data/)
   - fp8_e4m3_trace.json (FP8 E4M3 convergence trace)
   - fp16_trace.json (FP16 convergence trace)
   - fp32_trace.json (FP32 convergence trace)
   - fp64_trace.json (FP64 convergence trace)
   - cascade_trace.json (cascading precision trace with segments)

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

- No build step required - pure HTML/CSS/JS
- Chart.js 4.4.0 loaded from CDN
- Async/await for data loading
- Responsive design with mobile breakpoints
- Logarithmic scale for 16+ orders of magnitude
- Animation loop with configurable speed (1x-20x)
- Color palette matches precision formats consistently

DEPLOYMENT:

Ready for GitHub Pages deployment:
1. Repository Settings → Pages
2. Source: Deploy from branch
3. Branch: main, Folder: /docs
4. Save

No additional configuration needed. GitHub Pages will serve index.html automatically.

LOCAL TESTING:

python -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000

DESIGN NOTES:

- Professional messaging (educational research project)
- No mention of job applications or recruiters
- Emphasis on mathematical precision and performance tradeoffs
- Clean, modern aesthetic suitable for academic/technical audience
- Accessible color contrast and typography
- Interactive elements with clear affordances
